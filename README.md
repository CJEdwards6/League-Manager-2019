# League-Manager-2019

LM2019 will be a web-based database application that will allow sports league organizers to have an
accurate and systematic way to store all league information.
The LM2019 administrator will create and manage games and team data.
LM2019 will also allow members to create other organization events via the FullCalendar API.
